Casting Image Classification
Description:
This project involves classifying images of industrial castings into two categories: Defective and Non-Defective. The classification is done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which achieved an accuracy of 79% on the dataset. This model helps in identifying defects in castings, crucial for quality control in manufacturing industries.

Key Features:
Classifies casting images into defective and non-defective categories
Utilizes a CNN model for image classification
Achieved an accuracy of 79% on the test data
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
